## Code to Connect another computer on LAN


</div>

### Description

This article demonstrates how to programmatically create and remove network connections by using Windows API functions. The following example will add a connection to a network share and will disconnect from the same share.
 
### More Info
 
Computer Name

UserName

Password

U can connect programmatically to another computer on LAN

Connection Successfull

Connection Unsuccessfull

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a module to the project.

3. Copy and paste the following Declares and Type into the module: (NOTE: If you add this to a Form module, make all entries Private.)

4. Add two CommandButtons to Form1. These will be Command1 and Command2 by default.

5. Add the following code to Form1, substituting a valid share name for "\\ServerName\ShareName":

Run the project and click on Command1. You will get a Message dialog indicating success or failure. If successful, you should be able to look in Windows Explorer and see the new connection (unless you left lpLocalName undefined, in which case the connection does not show in Explorer). Click Command2 and go to Explorer, where you should see that the connection has been removed.
